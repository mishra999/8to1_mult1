# 4to1_test_8mult_new.py

read the binary drs4 file
get the time sequences for each trigger cell in an array 'time_samples'
allign the time sequences for ch 1, 2, 3 for each trigger cell
413-476, divide the multiplexed signals for each resonator
503-512, recover the pulses produced by 50 MHz resonator
585-680, recover max amplitude and time at 50% max for pulses for 50 MHz resonator
705-728, plot spectrum of original and recovered pulses to get compton edge for calibration
797-833, plot comparison and residual for 50 MHz
858- 1044, for 60 MHz
1050- 1473, for 65 MHz
1479- 1498, plot inset plot along with main plot
1501- 1802, for 65 MHz
1807- 1997, for 65 MHz
